% Specify the values for measuring time shifts

% Specification about the time period the reference is stacked over. The 
% options are the whole period (default), months (the first and last day of
% the correlation period must be specified), surrounding_days, firstdays 
% (number of days must be specified), and increase (for using the signal of
% the first day as reference in the first iteration and then a specified 
% numdays for the next iteration):

% Specification about which part of the signal should be used to measure 
% the timeshift, the options are all (default), separated, whole, positive 
% and negative
signalpart = whole

% Only use signals with correlation coefficient above the specified 
% threshold (if the stackperiod 'increase' is chosen, the threshold will 
% increase by 0.2 during the second iteration):

% Specify whether the inversion should be perfomed on the directly measured 
% time shifts ('direct') or the linearly fitted time shift ('linfit'):

% Specification about the time period the measured time shifts should be 
% linearly fitted, clear jumps should be omitted. Give as stationname (default is
% 'all' for all stations), the first day of the time period and the last (degault is the entire period):
